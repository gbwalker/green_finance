# Green Finance for Chinese Overseas Investment

This report unpacks the environmental governance issues that Chinese multinational corporations encounter overseas and prescribes green finance solutions to address them. It assesses challenges in the host-country, domestic, and international contexts, and surveys the landscape of green finance to identify mechanisms relevant to overseas investment. In total it draws from more than 140 textual sources and six expert interviews.

It offers five policy recommendations for Chinese institutional stakeholders and evaluates the outcomes of each recommendation for efficiency, feasibility, expedience, and sustainability. While acknowledging the limitations of green finance, it aims to chart a practical path for applying innovative tools to entrenched environmental challenges.
